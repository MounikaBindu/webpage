<p style="font-size:30px;"><b>Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)</b> is an academic program at many universities which comprises scientific and engineering aspects of computing. CSE is also a term often used in Europe to translate the name of engineering informatics academic programs. It is offered in both Undergraduate as well Postgraduate with specializations.</p>
<p style="font-size:30px;">It encompasses a variety of topics that relates to computation, like analysis of <u>algorithms, programming languages, program design, software, and computer hardware</u>.Computer Science engineering has roots in electrical engineering, mathematics, and linguistics. In the past Computer Science was taught as part of mathematics or engineering departments & in the recent days it has emerged as a separate engineering field.</p>
